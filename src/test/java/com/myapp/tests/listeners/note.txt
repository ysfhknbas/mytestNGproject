*****LISTENERS*****
*What is Listeners?
-It is used to listen the test cases to understand the status such as PASS, FAIL, SKIP, EXCEPTION, RUN,...
*How do/did you use Listeners?
-I used listeners in my testNG project.
-I used it for auto-capturing the screenshots for failed test cases(ITestListener interface onTestFailure method)
-I also used it for auto-rerunning failed test cases(IRetryAnalyzer interface)
-We can do many more such as generating extra reports or controlling the flow of test cases.
-I actually have a ListenerUtils in my framework to use listeners easily and automatically
-We can LINK listeners and tset classes using Listener annotation or xml files
-I personally use xml files cause that are more generic.
